# about_me
Hi all, this is my way to say 🖐!! To all of you coding experts, juniors, and beginners coders, this is a big challenge for my family and me.  😏 My path to change my career begun four months ago. I took this decision because of the Covid situation, and a new started in Canada. As an immigrant to this beautiful country, I realize that the IT world is a big thing here. And it would take the same effort to return to my actual career than look for a developer career.   I've seen a lot of Youtube videos about the change of career and I've read a lot of comments on Reddit about people changing their main study to IT, and they inspired me to do it too. It is impressive how the bright minds of programmers and developers make our world easy every day and how they give their knowledge to the benefit of the people (I mean open source '😁).  I hope not to fall and leave this new challenge in my life. I am committed to finishing and became a developer. So for all of those who will read this future and are struggling, just let me tell you that you are not alone and you can do it, and remember if someone else did it, we can do it too.   Also,  this will help me to improve my English too '🤗.
